#readme
the chat room realizes the functions of a chatroom.

Any one can build up a room as an owner. 

Anyone can get in any room if the room name and password he inputs are right. 

Then Anyone in a room can send a public message and he can send a private message to a particular user who is in the same room. 

The owner can kick any user, ban any user and change the room's password.





Creative Part:
Anyone can add his profile and see his own profile immediately. He can decide whether his profile can be seen by others. 

Anyone can view others' profile by querying only if the owner of the profile allows others to view his profiles.
